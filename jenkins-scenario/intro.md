In this scenario, you'll learn how to configure Jenkins to, run tests, build Docker images based on a Dockerfile, and deploy containers. The scenario is designed to demonstrate how you can use Docker within a CI/CD pipeline in an automated manner compared to our previous scenario where we did everything manually.


In this scenario you will run a Django application written in Python language.

So first, you will install and configure Jenkins to make a pipeline.

You will also learn how to specify where your pipeline will run.

Then, you will install some plugins to help you in our pipeline to run our application.

After that, you will make the pipeline and add different stages with different tasks.

Finally, you will check our running application and see how well you did ;).
